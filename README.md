The more you have, the worse it gets


Pirate Option
-------------

Diddy:
Yo ho ho
Pirates we shall be
But beware too much gold
In your hold
Or it's Davey Jones' locker for thee

To View:
python -m SimpleHTTPServer &

Game Idea:
You must navigate around islands to pick up Coins
But you have to bring them back to your pirate fortress (skull volcano island)
before you sink
How do we make this a "balance" thing..? Add chaising ships? sea monsters?
No idea.. i kind of jsut wanted to make a 3d pirate ship
Goood Night.
